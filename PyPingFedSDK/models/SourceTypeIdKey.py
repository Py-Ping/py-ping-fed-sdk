class SourceTypeIdKey():
    """ A key that is meant to reference a source from which an attribute can be retrieved. This model is usually paired with a value which, depending on the SourceType, can be a hardcoded value or a reference to an attribute name specific to that SourceType. Not all values are applicable - a validation error will be returned for incorrect values.<br>For each SourceType, the value should be:<br>ACCOUNT_LINK - If account linking was enabled for the browser SSO, the value must be 'Local User ID', unless it has been overridden in PingFederate's server configuration.<br>ADAPTER - The value is one of the attributes of the IdP Adapter.<br>ASSERTION - The value is one of the attributes coming from the SAML assertion.<br>AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_CONTRACT - The value is one of the attributes coming from an authentication policy contract.<br>LOCAL_IDENTITY_PROFILE - The value is one of the fields coming from a local identity profile.<br>CONTEXT - The value must be one of the following ['TargetResource' or 'OAuthScopes' or 'ClientId' or 'AuthenticationCtx' or 'ClientIp' or 'Locale' or 'StsBasicAuthUsername' or 'StsSSLClientCertSubjectDN' or 'StsSSLClientCertChain' or 'VirtualServerId' or 'AuthenticatingAuthority' or 'DefaultPersistentGrantLifetime']<br>CLAIMS - Attributes provided by the OIDC Provider.<br>CUSTOM_DATA_STORE - The value is one of the attributes returned by this custom data store.<br>EXPRESSION - The value is an OGNL expression.<br>EXTENDED_CLIENT_METADATA - The value is from an OAuth extended client metadata parameter. This source type is deprecated and has been replaced by EXTENDED_PROPERTIES.<br>EXTENDED_PROPERTIES - The value is from an OAuth Client's extended property.<br>IDP_CONNECTION - The value is one of the attributes passed in by the IdP connection.<br>JDBC_DATA_STORE - The value is one of the column names returned from the JDBC attribute source.<br>LDAP_DATA_STORE - The value is one of the LDAP attributes supported by your LDAP data store.<br>MAPPED_ATTRIBUTES - The value is the name of one of the mapped attributes that is defined in the associated attribute mapping.<br>OAUTH_PERSISTENT_GRANT - The value is one of the attributes from the persistent grant.<br>PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL_VALIDATOR - The value is one of the attributes of the PCV.<br>NO_MAPPING - A placeholder value to indicate that an attribute currently has no mapped source.TEXT - A hardcoded value that is used to populate the corresponding attribute.<br>TOKEN - The value is one of the token attributes.<br>REQUEST - The value is from the request context such as the CIBA identity hint contract or the request contract for Ws-Trust.<br>TRACKED_HTTP_PARAMS - The value is from the original request parameters.<br>SUBJECT_TOKEN - The value is one of the OAuth 2.0 Token exchange subject_token attributes.<br>ACTOR_TOKEN - The value is one of the OAuth 2.0 Token exchange actor_token attributes.<br>TOKEN_EXCHANGE_PROCESSOR_POLICY - The value is one of the attributes coming from a Token Exchange Processor policy.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : string
        The attribute source ID that refers to the attribute source that this key references. In some resources, the ID is optional and will be ignored. In these cases the ID should be omitted. If the source type is not an attribute source then the ID can be omitted.
    type : str
        The source type of this key.
