    Attributes
    ----------
    type: SourceTypeIdKeyType
        The source type of this key.

    id: str
        The attribute source ID that refers to the attribute source that this key references. In some resources, the ID is optional and will be ignored. In these cases the ID should be omitted. If the source type is not an attribute source then the ID can be omitted.
